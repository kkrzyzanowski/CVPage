<div class="text">
<p class="text-left fade">Hi, I'm Karol, and this is the part where I’m supposed to make myself sound impressive. Let's see how that goes. :)</p>

<p class="text-right fade">I'm a programmer. A creative one? Well… I’d like to think so, but reality keeps proving me otherwise. Still, I keep trying.</p>

<p class="fade">I enjoy playing games—mostly single-player RPGs like The Witcher 3, God of War, and Dragon Age: Origins. Sometimes, I make questionable life choices and play Rocket League.</p>

<p class="fade">When I’m not staring at code, I occasionally engage in normal human activities like swimming, running, or going to the gym. Allegedly, it’s good for you.</p>

<p class="fade">I like solving creative programming challenges—especially those involving graphics, math, games, or visualization. Algorithms? Sure, but only if they don’t make me question my existence.</p>

<p class="fade">Right now, I’m trying to move my career towards something visually engaging—graphics, web pages, games. I have no idea where I’ll end up, but I’d prefer it to be **anywhere but another corporate CRUD app**.</p>
